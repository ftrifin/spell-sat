# Doxyfile 1.2.15
#
# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = SPELL

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 2.0

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./apidocs/

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all 
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this 
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language. 
# The default language is English, other supported languages are: 
# Brazilian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, 
# German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, 
# Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish and Swedish.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in 
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. 
# Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless 
# the EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class 
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file 
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs) 
# defined locally in source files will be included in the documentation. 
# If set to NO only classes defined in header files are included.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all 
# undocumented members of documented classes, files or namespaces. 
# If set to NO (the default) these members will be included in the 
# various overviews, but no documentation section is generated. 
# This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.

HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = NO

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all 
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. 
# If set to NO (the default) these class will be included in the various 
# overviews. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = YES

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in 
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). 
# Set to NO to disable this.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend 
# the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description. 
# Note: if both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the 
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then 
# Doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief 
# description.

ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = YES

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all inherited 
# members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those members were 
# ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment operators of 
# the base classes will not be shown.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full 
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set 
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag 
# can be used to strip a user defined part of the path. Stripping is 
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of 
# the path. It is allowed to use relative paths in the argument list.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = 

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation 
# that is typed after a \internal command is included. If the tag is set 
# to NO (the default) then the documentation will be excluded. 
# Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = NO

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES (the default) will instruct 
# doxygen to hide any special comment blocks from generated source code 
# fragments. Normal C and C++ comments will always remain visible.

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then Doxygen will only generate 
# file names in lower case letters. If set to YES upper case letters are also 
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ 
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows 
# users are adviced to set this option to NO.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter 
# (but less readable) file names. This can be useful is your file systems 
# doesn't support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.

SHORT_NAMES            = NO

# If the HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES tag is set to NO (the default) then Doxygen 
# will show members with their full class and namespace scopes in the 
# documentation. If set to YES the scope will be hidden.

HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES       = NO

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen 
# will generate a verbatim copy of the header file for each class for 
# which an include is specified. Set to NO to disable this.

VERBATIM_HEADERS       = YES

# If the SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen 
# will put list of the files that are included by a file in the documentation 
# of that file.

SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES     = YES

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style 
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc 
# comments  will behave just like the Qt-style comments (thus requiring an 
# explict @brief command for a brief description.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented 
# member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it 
# reimplements.

INHERIT_DOCS           = YES

# If the INLINE_INFO tag is set to YES (the default) then a tag [inline] 
# is inserted in the documentation for inline members.

INLINE_INFO            = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then doxygen 
# will sort the (detailed) documentation of file and class members 
# alphabetically by member name. If set to NO the members will appear in 
# declaration order.

SORT_MEMBER_DOCS       = YES

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC 
# tag is set to YES, then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first 
# member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default 
# all members of a group must be documented explicitly.

DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. 
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or 
# disable (NO) the todo list. This list is created by putting \todo 
# commands in the documentation.

# disable (NO) the test list. This list is created by putting \test 
# commands in the documentation.

# The GENERATE_BUGLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or 
# disable (NO) the bug list. This list is created by putting \bug 
# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_BUGLIST       = YES

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts 
# as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form "name=value". 
# For example adding "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" will allow you to 
# put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which 
# will result in a user defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:". 
# You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.

# @ref in KDE docu are for kdoc, doxygen doesn't need them, so we alias them
# to nothing here

ENABLED_SECTIONS       = 

# The MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES tag determines the maximum number of lines 
# the initial value of a variable or define consist of for it to appear in 
# the documentation. If the initializer consists of more lines than specified 
# here it will be hidden. Use a value of 0 to hide initializers completely. 
# The appearance of the initializer of individual variables and defines in the 
# documentation can be controlled using \showinitializer or \hideinitializer 
# command in the documentation regardless of this setting.

MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES  = 30

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources 
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C.

# of all members will be omitted, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java sources 
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for Java. 
# For instance namespaces will be presented as packages, qualified scopes 
# will look different, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA   = NO

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated 
# at the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES the 
# list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.

# for undocumented members. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag will 
# automatically be disabled.

WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED   = YES

# The WARN_FORMAT tag determines the format of the warning messages that 
# doxygen can produce. The string should contain the $file, $line, and $text 
# tags, which will be replaced by the file and line number from which the 
# warning originated and the warning text.

WARN_FORMAT            = 

# The WARN_LOGFILE tag can be used to specify a file to which warning 
# and error messages should be written. If left blank the output is written 
# to stderr.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces.

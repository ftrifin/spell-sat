 * to save memory. Note that it is created with weak-references for both, the key and the value,
 * so, it should be safe to assume that it will be available for garbage collecting once
 * no other place has a reference to the same string.
 * 
 * Still, use this with care...

 * Note: should be safe to use in a threaded environment.

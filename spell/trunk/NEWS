=============================================

   The version of Python required to compile SPELL is the 2.5.x series
with an official patch that comes only as of version 2.7. It is very
likely that you will install it in an alternate folder such as /opt.

In order to compile SPELL, before running the configure utility or anytime you
want to compile SPELL, make sure that the PATH environment variable points to
this folder first. For bash, it would look like the following:

    export PATH=/opt/oldies/bin:$PATH

On the other hand, set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LDFLAGS variables to
the appropriate value:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oldies/lib
    ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/oldies/lib

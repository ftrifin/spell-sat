## SPELL Update - version 2.0.8 ##

This update includes a number of corrections required for the execution environment of SPELL:

  * Synchronization library fixes
  * Correct processing of PAUSE command in some situations
  * Minor corrections for the Shell view in the SPELL-GUI
  * Improve the information given to user when sending groups of commands

The changes affect the **SPELL-GUI** and the **execution** environment, but not the development environment. It is recommended to upgrade to this release since it improves the overall system behavior with respect to the previous version 2.0.5. This version is being used for satellite operations.

Please note that the **SPELL build manual** has been also corrected to include more detailed information regarding the COTS required to build SPELL correctly.

## Downloading SPELL ##

It is strongly recommended to build and install SPELL from source code, following the instructions of the **SPELL Build Manual**. The source code can be anonymously checked out from these two locations:

```
    svn checkout http://spell-sat.googlecode.com/svn/spell/trunk/ workspace
    svn checkout http://spell-sat.googlecode.com/svn/spell-dev/trunk/ workspace-dev
```

Notice that the source code is divided in **two projects**. The first one, "spell", contains the execution environment. The second one, "spell-dev", contains the development environment. These checkouts are **read only**.

In any case, we are providing sample binaries for GNU/Linux platform. These binaries have been tested in the GNU/Linux distribution **SuSE Enterprise 10** (32 bits). The **Quick Start Guide** contains the details for installing these binary packages.

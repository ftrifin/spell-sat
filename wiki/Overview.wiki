=SPELL - Satellite Procedure Execution Language & Library=

SPELL is a free Open Source software package composed of an integrated environment for the development and execution of satellite automated procedures. It is capable of running any procedure via different Ground Control System and for any spacecraft.

The goal of SPELL is to have a powerful and readable automation language, which can be shared across Satellite Operators and Satellite Manufacturers. If we all use the same language, the cost and the risk associated with automated procedures will go down!

SPELL facilitates the automation of satellite operations, allowing satellite procedures to be run in a highly repeatable and reliable manner. User manuals provide guidance on the correct use and steps to integrate the software into their existing ground control systems via the well-defined programming interface. SPELL consists of five integral applications which users can use as a complete software suite or as individual standalone applications. Source code documentation is also provided giving the users freedom to customise the system to meet their own needs.

The wish is to create a community to share experience and procedures (via the Satellite Manufacturers) with the other Satellite Operators.

==SPELL, a History==

SES has been developing the Satellite Procedure Execution Language and Library (SPELL) based on 25 years of expertise in satellite fleet operations. SES is now making this software available under the no-obligation, no-fee license to improve the overall quality and reliability of satellite operating procedures throughout the industry. SES hopes that such a system will promote standardisation in the industry and further minimise the risks inherent in satellite operations.

SPELL is used since 2009 for the automated operations of several geostationary communication satellites in flight.

==SPELL is Open Source==

SES is releasing this software under FLOSS (free/libre/open source software) licenses to improve the overall collaboration, quality and reliability of satellite operating procedures throughout the industry.

SES ENGINEERING is in the process of forming a Steering Committee to ensure the continued evolution of this software and its acceptance as a standard within the satellite industry. 

==SPELL Components==

SPELL provides the following components:

    * a real-time execution environment to interface with different Ground Control Systems
    * a Eclipse RCP based GUI to run the satellite procedures
    * a language library which extends the fully-available Python syntax towards satellite operations
    * a development environment based on Eclipse RCP, with integrated revision control for the management of the procedures

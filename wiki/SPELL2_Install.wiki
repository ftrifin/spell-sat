#summary Installing SPELL 2.0

==Downloading SPELL==

It is strongly recommended to build and install SPELL from source code, following the instructions of the *SPELL Build Manual*. The source code can be anonymously checked out from these two locations:

{{{
    svn checkout http://spell-sat.googlecode.com/svn/spell/trunk/ workspace
    svn checkout http://spell-sat.googlecode.com/svn/spell-dev/trunk/ workspace-dev
}}}  

Notice that the source code is divided in *two projects*. The first one, "spell", contains the execution environment. The second one, "spell-dev", contains the development environment. These checkouts are *read only*. 

In any case, we are providing sample binaries for GNU/Linux platform. These binaries have been tested in the GNU/Linux distribution *SuSE Enterprise 10* (32 bits). The *Quick Start Guide* contains the details for installing these binary packages.
